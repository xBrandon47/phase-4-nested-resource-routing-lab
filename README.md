# Nested Resource Routing Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create nested routes
- Use params in nested routes

## Introduction

In this lab, we'll continue working on our Craigslist-style marketplace API, and
build out some nested routes to give users easier access to our data.

```txt
User -< Item
```

Get the lab set up by running:

```console
$ bundle install
bundle install$ rails db:migrate db:seed
```

There is seed data in place so you can test your solution out in Postman. You
can also run `learn test` to run the tests.

## Instructions

You will need to handle the requests listed below and return the appropriate
JSON data in the response.

**Note:** watch out for [Rails' `DoubleRenderError`][double render error] as you
work. The error is fairly straightforward: Rails only allows `render` to be
called once in an action. We have seen one way to avoid this error: by using
conditional code to ensure that only one `render` executes. A second way to
avoid the error is to include an explicit `return`, eg: `return render json: ...` to keep any later `render` statements from executing.

### Nested Items Index Route

This route should show all items for one individual user.

```txt
GET /users/:user_id/items

Response Body
-------
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Non-stick pan",
    "description": "Sticks a bit",
    "price": 10,
    "user_id": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Ceramic plant pots",
    "description": "Plants not included",
    "price": 31,
    "user_id": 1
  }
]
```

### Nested Item Show Route

This route should show one item matching the `:id` from the URL.

```txt
GET /users/:user_id/items/:id

Response Body
-------
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Non-stick pan",
  "description": "Sticks a bit",
  "price": 10,
  "user_id": 1
}
```

### Nested Item Create Route

This route should create a new item that belongs to a user.

```txt
POST /users/:user_id/items

Headers:
-------
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
-------
{
  "name": "Garden gnomes",
  "description": "No refunds",
  "price": 23
}

Response Body:
-------
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Garden gnomes",
  "description": "No refunds",
  "price": 23,
  "user_id": 1
}
```
